Requirements for demjson
========================

demjson is a pure Python module; it does not contain any C code
extensions. It also does not have any dependencies on any third-party
modules; it only uses the standard Python library.

It will work with both Python 2 and Python 3; though at least Python
2.4 is recommended.  If you plan to use it with Python 3, also read
the "docs/PYTHON3.txt" file included with this release.

Note: for full Unicode support of non-BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane)
characters, your Python interpreter must have been compiled for UCS-4
support.  You can check this with:

    import sys
    sys.maxunicode > 0xffff  # If True you have UCS-4 support


Installation of demjson
=======================

This software is published in the Python Package Index (PYPI),
at <http://pypi.python.org/>, which may make it easy to install.
If your system has either "pip" or "easy_install", then you may
try one of the following commands to install this module:

    pip install demjson
    pip-python install demjson
    easy_install demjson

Otherwise, you can install it by downloading the distrubtion and
unpacking it in some temporary directory.  Then inside that
directory, type:

    python setup.py install

Optionally, for a minimal installation, you can also just copy the
"demjson.py" file into your own project's directory.


jsonlint command
================

The installation should have installed the script file "jsonlint".

If it did not, you can simply copy the file "jsonlint" to any
directory in your executable PATH, such as into /usr/local/bin under
Unix/Linux.  Make sure the script is set as being executable, and if
needed adjust the first "#!" line to point to your python interpreter.


Running self tests
==================

Self tests are included which conform to the Python unittest
framework.  To run these tests, do

    cd test
    PYTHONPATH=.. python test_demjson.py
